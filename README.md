## Approach Taken

The approach I took was to first understand the math of Tower of Hanoi first. With that knowledge I tried to apply it when building the game. However, through a lot of effort, I could not get a single block to move. The final approach I took was to compare the number text within the div of each tile and set conditions so that the small integers can stack on top of the bigger one and not vice versa. This proved effective as the blocks were able to move and stack upon one another in the correct manner. Lastly, I made my game Pokemon themed.
